            <p>
                Green Tree Capital is a small, independent project run by two friends who are
                passionate about sustainable, ethical and long-term investing.
            </p>
            <p>
                We track our own portfolios publicly, share our thinking, and document our wins
                and mistakes so others can learn alongside us.

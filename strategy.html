            <h1>Our Strategy & Philosophy</h1>
            <p>
                Our main focus is on sustainable, ethical and long-term investing.

            <h2>Time Horizon</h2>
            <p>
                We divide our approach into long-term and medium-term buckets:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Long-term:</strong> multi-year holdings in quality companies or ETFs.</li>
                <li><strong>Medium-term:</strong> trades driven by macro or valuation shifts.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Risk Management</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Position sizing based on conviction and volatility</li>
                <li>Diversification across sectors and regions</li>
                <li>Clear invalidation levels for trades</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Sustainability Focus</h2>
            <p>
                We prefer businesses that align with long-term environmental and social goals,
                though we may still analyse and comment on wider markets for educational reasons.
